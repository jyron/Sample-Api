Product API and Basic Frontend
Objective: Develop a backend API and a basic frontend interface to display product information.
Backend Requirements:
- Create a RESTful API using a backend framework of choice (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask, or Ruby on Rails).
- Design and implement a simple database schema to store product information, including product name, description, category, and price.
- Implement API endpoints for retrieving product information:
GET /api/products: Retrieve a list of all products with their basic details.
GET /api/products/{id}: Retrieve detailed information about a specific product.
- Implement basic error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes for API responses.
- Write a few unit tests to ensure the functionality of the API endpoints.
Frontend Requirements:
- Create a basic web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla JavaScript or a lightweight library like jQuery).
- Display a list of products retrieved from the backend API on the main page.
- Implement a simple search functionality to filter products by name or category.
- Create a product detail page that shows the details of a selected product, fetched from the backend API.
